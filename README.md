Newspaper Inventory Simulation Project
This project simulates a classical inventory problem involving the purchase and sale of newspapers. The goal is to determine the optimal number of newspapers a seller should purchase to maximize profit over a 20-day period.

Problem Description
The paper seller buys newspapers for 33 cents each and sells them for 50 cents each. Unsold newspapers at the end of the day are sold as scrap for 5 cents each. Newspapers can only be purchased in bundles of 10 (e.g., 50, 60, etc.). There are three types of newsdays - “good,” “fair,” and “poor” - each with its own probability distribution.

Simulation Details
The simulation will:

Run for 20 days.
Record daily profits based on demand, which varies depending on the type of newsday.
Provide insights on the optimal number of newspapers to purchase.
Parameters
Newspaper Purchase Price: $0.33 per paper
Newspaper Selling Price: $0.50 per paper
Newspaper Scrap Value: $0.05 per paper
Number of Papers Purchased by News Dealer: Varies by simulation
Probability distribution of news day types: Good, Fair, Poor
Demand probability distribution for each day type: Varies by day type
